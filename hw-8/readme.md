This week we learned about 'for' and 'while' loops. These loops allow the user to tell the computer to run a series of statements within a function block, "x" amount of times, this allows the coder to bypass making their fingers bleed writing thousands of lines of code. This weeks assignment I chose to keep it simple and have my code loop ellipses at random, it reminded me of fireflies.
