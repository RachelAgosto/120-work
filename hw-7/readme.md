Description of What the Original Code is Doing

Line 4 gives us the width of the ellipse. Lines 5 and 6 tells us the starting position of the ellipse made on either the x or y axis. Lines 7 through 10 dictate the change and how far each movement of the ellipse goes through the x and y axis. Lines 12-14 describe the size of the canvas, along with its background color. Within the function code in lines 21 and 22, the code is set up to multiply by itself so it can move forward. The 'if' statements within lines 25-29 constrain the ball within the canvas so it has a 'bouncing' effect. In the 'mousePressed' function, lines 37-38 allow the user to alter the original path preset in the code. The user can change the speed and path of the ball by simple mouse clicks. Each code starts and ends with a curly bracket ({}).

How did you alter the sketch?
I liked the example in the homework with the sorta see through colored ellipses so I made the cnavas full screen and made it black so the colors would pop better. then took away the strokes from the ellipses and made them a little smaller. Then I added a random color fill.
