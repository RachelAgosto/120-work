For this week I learned about variables and how they can be used to create
pictures in code. I was hoping to stay away from math because I am one that
stuggles with it. So for this week I stuck close to some examples so that
my code would work properly. I did run into a couple errors but was able to fix
them by putting push/pop boxes around them and checking my code for mistakes.
