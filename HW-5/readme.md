For this weeks assignment I wanted to create a simple animation.
I went over all the content provided and knew that I wanted to have something
spin in my animation. So i used the spining ellips to look like a propeller. I
also decided to have slow moving circles some out of the center of the propller.
I then made another pink circle to follow the mouse around.

Difficulties:
I has a few problems getting the code to work, for example the picture would
sometimes turn black when trying to run it.
