This week we worked with OOP's, which are objects that have attributes describing them, and its functions or methods of ways they can act within the coded sketch. I find that I am still not quite 100% sure how everything works and I still have various issues, I also relied heavily on examples provided. I was only able to do part of what I wanted with this project. I wanted to have happy dancing little penguins but was unalbe to make flapping arms work, so they just have dancing feet.
